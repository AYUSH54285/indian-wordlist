Introduction :india:
---
This repository hosts passwords collected from Indian demography suitable for brute force and study
the patterns of the human mindset when choosing the passwords.

### Why I stared this?
Whenever you want to brute force, you find or create a suitable wordlist.

When I searched the internet for wordlists (for my use case :wink:), I found very awesome ones but
mostly they were from foreign countries or from a wider area and people in my country (India :heart:)
are less likely to keep those passwords.
E.g. names of people, favorite team, places, or role models …

As those passwords were more personalized/specific to the user’s region from where they were collected,
they were not very useful to me. So I decided to create my own version.

**The passwords in this main file `indian-passwords` are not arranged in any order
(except when the pull requests were chronologically accepted) or frequency of their usage.**

What file is what?
---
The main file which hosts all the passwords is `indian-passwords`. Fork and commit passwords to this
file only.

Other files `indian-passwords-length8-20`,`indian-passwords-length8-20-sorted`, and `indian-passwords-sorted`
are autogenerated from the main file `indian-passwords` using pipeline. As the name suggestes
some have passwords with length 8-20 (suitable for WPA/WPA2) and some are alphabetically sorted.
